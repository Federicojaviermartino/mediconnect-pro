1. **Home**: `https://mediconnect-pro.onrender.com/`
2. **Health Check**: `https://mediconnect-pro.onrender.com/health`
3. **API Info**: `https://mediconnect-pro.onrender.com/api`

You should see JSON responses! 🎉

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations

- **Spin down after 15 minutes** of inactivity
- **First request after spin-down** takes 30-60 seconds

### Keeping Service Active

If you want instant response for client demos:

**Option 1:** Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month - keeps service always on)

**Option 2:** Use a uptime monitor (free):
- https://uptimerobot.com
- Pings your URL every 5 minutes
- Keeps service awake during demo hours

---

## 💰 Cost

**Free Plan:**
- ✅ Perfect for demos
- ✅ 750 hours/month
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ Auto-deploy from GitHub
- ✅ No credit card required

**Starter Plan ($7/month):**
- ✅ Always on (no spin-down)
- ✅ Better performance
- ✅ Priority support

**For your demo: FREE plan is enough!**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Service not responding"

- Service may have spun down (free tier)
- Wait 30-60 seconds and refresh
- Check logs in Render dashboard

### "Build failed"

1. Check build logs in Render
2. Make sure `package.json` is correct
3. Verify `server.js` exists

### "Application crashed"

1. Check logs for errors
2. Verify `node server.js` works locally
3. Check environment variables

### "Cannot connect to databases"

Currently the simple server doesn't use databases. To add:
1. Add database in Render dashboard
2. Get connection URL
3. Add as environment variable

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Full Application Deployment

If you want to deploy the complete microservices:

1. **Deploy each service separately** on Render
2. **Add databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
3. **Configure internal URLs** between services
4. **Estimated cost**: $25-35/month for all services

Or use **Docker** on Render:
1. One service with docker-compose
2. Uses Render's Docker runtime
3. Estimated cost: $15-20/month
